# HorKonpon

HorKonpon is a mobile app to report problems or suggest improvements to your local council. It uses **GPS** to detect your **current location** and you can **take a picture** or type text to describe your problem.

This information is then sent (in `JSON` format) to a central server which redirects the information to the corresponding council in the most appropiate way:
- As an `e-mail` with all information (**satellite images** of the location, **picture**, ...)
- As `JSON`/`XML`/`other` to integrate with third party software
- ...
